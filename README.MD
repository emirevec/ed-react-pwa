## Project Description

This repository is the culmination of a React course, where we delved into building a sophisticated ecommerce application using TypeScript and incorporating Progressive Web App (PWA) features. It's designed to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts and skills covered in the program. The implementation includes service workers and push notifications, ensuring a modern and seamless user experience.

## Workflow

We follow a development workflow inspired by GitFlow, which provides a structured approach to branch management. While we use GitFlow as a guideline, we also maintain the flexibility to adapt the workflow as needed to fit the requirements of our project.

## Progressive Web App Features, ServiceWorker and Push Notifications

This project incorporates Progressive Web App (PWA) functionalities, enhancing the user experience with features such as offline accessibility, app installability, and push notifications.

## Benefits of Using TypeScript

Adopting TypeScript in our React ecommerce project brings key advantages, including static typing for early error detection, enhanced code quality, improved developer productivity with better tooling support, and early prevention of runtime issues through static analysis, contributing to overall code reliability and maintainability.

## Tailwind CSS for Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling a utility-first approach to building user interfaces. Tailwind provides a comprehensive set of utility classes, making styling more intuitive and efficient while maintaining flexibility in design. Additionally, we leverage components created by Flowbite to enhance our UI implementation.
